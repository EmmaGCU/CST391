# Milestone 6: Final Presentation

## Introduction

- In this course, we learned several new technologies, including, React, Angular and Node.js. We created a Music application, which involved setting up a database, developing an API with various endpoints, and eventually implementing the front end, first using Angular, and then React. This project was continued throughout the course, and built on over time as we introduced new topics. Along side our learning, we also developed a project of our own design, using the same technologies as the music application.

## Christian Worldview

- As Christians we have a responsibility to make our applications both as secure and accessible as possible. As to security, this would mean implementing our code using best security practices in order to ensure the privacy of user data. As far as accessibility, practices such as using semantic tags where possible can help to make your application accessible via screenreaders and other such technologies. Responsive design is also important for the sake of making your application usable regardless of the screensize you are viewing it on. Ultimately we want to design our application to make the user experience as smooth and accessible as possbile.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

<b>Challenges:</b> Some of the biggest challenges throughout this course included configuration and navigation These were the most common bugs that I encountered. For example, making sure to import all of the necessary dependencies, figuring out how connect between the front end, API and database, and navigating between various routes within the application.

<b>Lessons Learned:</b> This course introduced me to the concept of JavaScript frameworks, and helped me gain a more solid understanding of what they are. I also learned how to use Express and Node.js as well as Angular. I have worked briefly with React before, but this course served as a good refresher and helped to develop my skills and understanding of it.

## Conclusion

- This course introduced some of the basics of web development. This included setting up and connecting to a database, developing an API, and implementing the front end using JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and React. We gained experience with these skills both through course activities as well as developing and implementing our own self-defined project.
